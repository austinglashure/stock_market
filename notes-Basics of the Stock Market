A Beginner's Guide to the Stock Market

THE WORLD'S GREATEST OPPORTUNITY MACHINE

investing = buying and holding for months or even years
    longer term strategy
    slower growth with less risk
    
trading = buying and selling quickly
    short term strategies
    more risky, and more complex
    high potential rewards
    
 - a smart person will be both a trader and an investor with many different strategies
    bonds, options, futures, currencies, venture capital, and real estate to name a few

stock = a share, or piece of ownership of a company
shares outstanding = how many shares of stock have been issued
stock price = the amount of money to purchase a share of a stock
market cap = short for market capitalization, is the total value of all the stocks in the market
    - as the market adjusts to new information and momentum, the stock price and market cap change
    
- the true value of the company can go up, while the stock price doesn't move, or even goes down despite the value of the company
- institutional players like hedge/mutual funds and pensions can have a large effect on the price of a stock

HOW TO GET STARTED WITH STOCKS

- stocks are sold at stock exchanges
stock exchange = a place where buyers and sellers show up and exchange stocks with each other
    - NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) and the NASDAQ
    - brokers and brokerages act as middlemen and facilitators for people to trade stocks on stock exchanges
    
- when buying a stock, you can use a market order or a money order
    market order = buying a stock as quickly as possible, even if its above market price
    - EX: say you make a market order of XYZ stock at $52, your order will be filled @ $52 or higher
    
    - every stock has a bid price and an offer or 'ask' price, a market order will pick the most immediate
        bid price = the price someone is willing to buy a stock, sometimes higher than market price
        ask price = the price someone is willing to sell the stock, sometimes lower than market price
        bid-ask spread = the difference between the bid price and the ask price
            - the bid-ask spread for very liquid stocks is very low, so it will let you fulfill an order quickly
            liquid = there is many stocks on the market, or a high float, and you can buy/sell many stocks without changing the price
            illiquid = the stock is rarer, with fewer shares in the market. there is more volatility
            
    limit order = buying a stock with a specified price
        - EX: now you make a limit order of XYZ stock @ $52, your order will only happend if it can be made at or below your price
    
    - you also have to choose between a day order or a GTC order
    day order = a trade that will only be executed during market hours, (0930-1630), and if it isnt fulfilled, it expires
    GTC order = stands for "good til cancelled" and won't expire until it's cancelled
    - there are pre-market and post-market trading sessions, ordinarily very liquid and stable stocks will behave wildly

MAKE MONEY WITH ETF'S

index = a collection of stocks packaged up, and treated as one stock
- popular indices are are the 'S&P 500' or the 'Dow Jones Industrial Average'
    - the S&P is made up of the 500 largest market caps on the NYSE
- stocks in these indexes are 'blue chip' or well established and large companies, and as such, their market cap and float is usually very high
    - as such, to participate in an index like the S&P, you have to buy one share of all 500 stocks, which prices some people out
    
ETF = 'Exchange Traded Fund' which trades just like a stock, and allows people to buy a portion of an index stock, for a small fee
- ETFs and indexes are great passive investing strategy that does the diversification for you
- 50% to 70% of the money in the stock market is tied up in indexing

passive investing strategy = any strategy that doesn't require much thinking or a lot of buying and selling
    - this is the advised strategy for new investors, it has lower risk, and is less complex
    
cost averaging = the practice of spending the same amount of money on an index regardless of market conditions to insure a good average price
- a good time to invest in indexes is during bear markets
    bear market = a market that reports consistent losses, will have pessimistic behavior

CREATING PASSIVE INCOME WITH DIVIDEND STOCKS

dividend stock = a stock that will make a cash payment into the brokerage account
- dividend stocks are an excellent way to start passively growing wealth
- EX: say you buy a dividend stock XYZ at $60 a share, taht pays 0.45 cents every quarter
    - thats $1.80 dividend at the price you paid, $60
    - 1.80/60 = 0.03 or 3%
dividend yield = annual dividend / initial investment, or the 3% figure above
- average savings account will have a 2% yield, which is lower than dividends, but is safer
- successuful companies will grow their dividend every year, @ a 7.2% growth, 10 years and the dividend doubles
- this will trickle down and double your dividend yield too, since you haven't invested more, and the dividend has doubled

HOW TO PICK STOCKS LIKE WARREN BUFFET

"Just but a part of a a wonderful company at a fair price and hold it for the next 50 years."

- you can copy him by reading his berkshire hathaway letters that he publishes regularly
    - you can calculate the average price Buffet has paid for a stock and see if you can buy the stock cheaper
        - especially in his newer picks, there can be real value
    - you could also buy a berkshire hathaway index, although they are hard to find
    
- Buffet's investing style condensed is to own businesses with good pricing power
    pricing power = a company's ability to raise their good/service's prices without losing customers
    - EX: Coca cola can raise the price of their can 10 cents and not lose business
    - strong, well known brands like Coca Cola and Apple
    
    - financial companies like Bank of America, Am-Ex, and Wells Fargo
        - financial companies are highly leveraged and get bailed out if things go bad
        
"The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. If you've got the poewr to raise prices without 
losing business to a competitor, you've got a very good business. And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the 
price by ten percent, then you've got a terrible business."

VALUE INVESTING AND P/E'S

- value investing is basically buying something that is unjustly being undervalued

P/E = price to earnings ratio, takes Stock price / Earnings per share
EPS = Earnings per Share,
- EX: say XYZ stock is trading at $100, and has earnings the last twelve months of $6.50
    - 100/ 6.50 = about 15, so the P/E of XYZ is 15
    
- companies that are growing their revenues or earnings, "growth stocks" tend to have P/Es over 25
- companies that are in trouble will have a P/E of below 10

- there is an old theory that value investing is buying a stock with a low P/E
    - this is because a low P/E means that you can potentially make more profit from a smaller investment
    - this is an antiquated outlook, and you shouldn't buy a stock with a P/E below 10 if you aren't an advanced investor
    - you shouldn't look in the bargain bin of cheap stocks to make a big gain unless you're coming out of a 5 year bear market

value trap = paying a cheap price for a stock that is going to 0
- the tech companies of yesteryear are almost never a good deal
- a low or falling stock price will also hurt that company's recruiting prospects and open it up to buyouts from tech giants
- never buy a stock just because it has a low P/E
