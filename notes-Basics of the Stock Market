A Beginner's Guide to the Stock Market

THE WORLD'S GREATEST OPPORTUNITY MACHINE

investing = buying and holding for months or even years
    longer term strategy
    slower growth with less risk
    
trading = buying and selling quickly
    short term strategies
    more risky, and more complex
    high potential rewards
    
 - a smart person will be both a trader and an investor with many different strategies
    bonds, options, futures, currencies, venture capital, and real estate to name a few

stock = a share, or piece of ownership of a company
shares outstanding = how many shares of stock have been issued
stock price = the amount of money to purchase a share of a stock
market cap = short for market capitalization, is the total value of all the stocks in the market
    - as the market adjusts to new information and momentum, the stock price and market cap change
    
- the true value of the company can go up, while the stock price doesn't move, or even goes down despite the value of the company
- institutional players like hedge/mutual funds and pensions can have a large effect on the price of a stock

HOW TO GET STARTED WITH STOCKS

- stocks are sold at stock exchanges
stock exchange = a place where buyers and sellers show up and exchange stocks with each other
    - NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) and the NASDAQ
    - brokers and brokerages act as middlemen and facilitators for people to trade stocks on stock exchanges
    
- when buying a stock, you can use a market order or a money order
    market order = buying a stock as quickly as possible, even if its above market price
    - EX: say you make a market order of XYZ stock at $52, your order will be filled @ $52 or higher
    
    - every stock has a bid price and an offer or 'ask' price, a market order will pick the most immediate
        bid price = the price someone is willing to buy a stock, sometimes higher than market price
        ask price = the price someone is willing to sell the stock, sometimes lower than market price
        bid-ask spread = the difference between the bid price and the ask price
            - the bid-ask spread for very liquid stocks is very low, so it will let you fulfill an order quickly
            liquid = there is many stocks on the market, or a high float, and you can buy/sell many stocks without changing the price
            illiquid = the stock is rarer, with fewer shares in the market. there is more volatility
            
    limit order = buying a stock with a specified price
        - EX: now you make a limit order of XYZ stock @ $52, your order will only happend if it can be made at or below your price
    
    - you also have to choose between a day order or a GTC order
    day order = a trade that will only be executed during market hours, (0930-1630), and if it isnt fulfilled, it expires
    GTC order = stands for "good til cancelled" and won't expire until it's cancelled
    - there are pre-market and post-market trading sessions, ordinarily very liquid and stable stocks will behave wildly

MAKE MONEY WITH ETF'S

index = a collection of stocks packaged up, and treated as one stock
- popular indices are are the 'S&P 500' or the 'Dow Jones Industrial Average'
    - the S&P is made up of the 500 largest market caps on the NYSE
- stocks in these indexes are 'blue chip' or well established and large companies, and as such, their market cap and float is usually very high
    - as such, to participate in an index like the S&P, you have to buy one share of all 500 stocks, which prices some people out
    
ETF = 'Exchange Traded Fund' which trades just like a stock, and allows people to buy a portion of an index stock, for a small fee
- ETFs and indexes are great passive investing strategy that does the diversification for you
- 50% to 70% of the money in the stock market is tied up in indexing

passive investing strategy = any strategy that doesn't require much thinking or a lot of buying and selling
    - this is the advised strategy for new investors, it has lower risk, and is less complex
    
cost averaging = the practice of spending the same amount of money on an index regardless of market conditions to insure a good average price
- a good time to invest in indexes is during bear markets
    bear market = a market that reports consistent losses, will have pessimistic behavior
